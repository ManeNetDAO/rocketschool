## Atoms

Atoms are the basic building blocks of matter. Applied to web interfaces, atoms are our HTML tags, such as a form label, an input or a button.

## Molecules

Molecules are groups of atoms bonded together and are the smallest fundamental units of a compound. These molecules take on their own properties and serve as the backbone of our design systems.

For example, a form label, input or button aren’t too useful by themselves, but combine them together as a form and now they can actually do something together.

## Organisms

Organisms are groups of molecules joined together to form a relatively complex, distinct section of an interface.

Organisms can consist of similar and/or different molecule types. For example, a masthead organism might consist of diverse components like a logo, primary navigation, search form, and list of social media channels. But a “product grid” organism might consist of the same molecule (possibly containing a product image, product title and price) repeated over and over again.

## Templates

At the template stage, we break our chemistry analogy to get into language that makes more sense to our clients and our final output. 

These are simply the highest level component that can apply to entire pages, but are labeled as `templates` because a single template can potentially create multiple pages just seeded with different content.
